In case it didn't dawn on you by now, I made this entire website using GitHub pages, HTML, SCSS, Ruby, and a little bit of that good old magical sprinkle of JavaScript just to make things pop! 
Making this website was fun and very educational for refining my coding capabilities. I still plan on adding more and more to it as time passes, so it can grow with me and become a sort of trophy room for whatever.
Projects I either do myself or get hired to do if that does come to fruition but either way I can't wait to add more to this place as time passes and I hope whoever is reading this checks in every once in and awhile to find 
any potential updates and cool little gizmos i so happened to just add on a whim! So anyway ENJOY YOUR VISIT!
